Recommendations with IBM
In this notebook, you will be putting your recommendation skills to use on real data from the IBM Watson Studio platform.

You may either submit your notebook through the workspace here, or you may work from your local machine and submit through the next page. Either way assure that your code passes the project RUBRIC. Please save regularly.

By following the table of contents, you will build out a number of different methods for making recommendations that can be used for different situations.

Part I : Exploratory Data Analysis
Use the dictionary and cells below to provide some insight into the descriptive statistics of the data.

1. What is the distribution of how many articles a user interacts with in the dataset? Provide a visual and descriptive statistics to assist with giving a look at the number of times each user interacts with an article.

In [3]:
per_user = df.groupby('email').count()['article_id']
In [4]:
per_user.hist(bins=10)
Out[4]:

25%         1.000000
50%         3.000000
75%         9.000000
max       364.000000
Name: article_id, dtype: float64
In [6]:
per_user.median()
Out[6]:
3.0
In [7]:
# Fill in the median and maximum number of user_article interactios below

median_val = 3 # 50% of individuals interact with ____ number of articles or fewer.
max_views_by_user = 364 # The maximum number of user-article interactions by any 1 user is ______.
2. Explore and remove duplicate articles from the df_content dataframe.

In [8]:
# Find and explore duplicate articles
df_content.nunique()
Out[8]:
doc_body           1036
doc_description    1022
doc_full_name      1051
doc_status            1
article_id         1051
dtype: int64
In [9]:
df_content.shape
Out[9]:
(1056, 5)
In [10]:
# Remove any rows that have the same article_id - only keep the first
df_content.drop_duplicates(subset='article_id', inplace=True)
3. Use the cells below to find:

a. The number of unique articles that have an interaction with a user.
b. The number of unique articles in the dataset (whether they have any interactions or not).
c. The number of unique users in the dataset. (excluding null values)
d. The number of user-article interactions in the dataset.

In [11]:
df.nunique()
Out[11]:
article_id     714
title          714
email         5148
dtype: int64
In [12]:
df.shape
Out[12]:
(45993, 3)
In [13]:
unique_articles = 714 # The number of unique articles that have at least one interaction
total_articles = 1051 # The number of unique articles on the IBM platform
unique_users = 5148 # The number of unique users
user_article_interactions = 45993 # The number of user-article interactions
4. Use the cells below to find the most viewed article_id, as well as how often it was viewed. After talking to the company leaders, the email_mapper function was deemed a reasonable way to map users to ids. There were a small number of null values, and it was found that all of these null values likely belonged to a single user (which is how they are stored using the function below).

In [14]:
df.groupby(by='article_id').count().sort_values(by='email', ascending=False).head()
Out[14]:
title	email
article_id		
1429.0	937	937
1330.0	927	927
1431.0	671	671
1427.0	643	643
1364.0	627	627
In [15]:
most_viewed_article_id = '1429.0' # The most viewed article in the dataset as a string with one value following the decimal 
max_views = 937 # The most viewed article in the dataset was viewed how many times?
In [16]:
## No need to change the code here - this will be helpful for later parts of the notebook
# Run this cell to map the user email to a user_id column and remove the email column

def email_mapper():
    coded_dict = dict()
    cter = 1
    email_encoded = []
    
    for val in df['email']:
        if val not in coded_dict:
            coded_dict[val] = cter
            cter+=1
        
        email_encoded.append(coded_dict[val])
    return email_encoded

email_encoded = email_mapper()
del df['email']
df['user_id'] = email_encoded

# show header
df.head()
Out[16]:

It looks like you have everything right here! Nice job!
Part II: Rank-Based Recommendations
Unlike in the earlier lessons, we don't actually have ratings for whether a user liked an article or not. We only know that a user has interacted with an article. In these cases, the popularity of an article can really only be based on how often an article was interacted with.

1. Fill in the function below to return the n top articles ordered with most interactions as the top. Test your function using the tests below.

In [ ]:

In [18]:
top_articles = list(df.groupby(by='title').count().sort_values(by='user_id', ascending=False).head(6).index)

# Test your function by returning the top 5, 10, and 20 articles
top_5 = get_top_articles(5)

t.sol_2_test(get_top_articles)
Your top_5 looks like the solution list! Nice job.
Your top_10 looks like the solution list! Nice job.
Your top_20 looks like the solution list! Nice job.
Part III: User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
1. Use the function below to reformat the df dataframe to be shaped with users as the rows and articles as the columns.

Each user should only appear in each row once.
Each article should only show up in one column.
If a user has interacted with an article, then place a 1 where the user-row meets for that article-column. It does not matter how many times a user has interacted with the article, all entries where a user has interacted with an article should be a 1.
If a user has not interacted with an item, then place a zero where the user-row meets for that article-column.
Use the tests to make sure the basic structure of your matrix matches what is expected by the solution.

df.head()
Out[23]:

    OUTPUT:

    an article and a 0 otherwise
    '''
    # Fill in the function here
    
    user_item = df.groupby(by=['user_id', 'article_id']).agg(lambda x: 1).unstack().fillna(0)
    
    return user_item # return the user_item matrix 

user_item = create_user_item_matrix(df)
In [25]:
## Tests: You should just need to run this cell.  Don't change the code.
assert user_item.shape[0] == 5149, "Oops!  The number of users in the user-article matrix doesn't look right."
assert user_item.shape[1] == 714, "Oops!  The number of articles in the user-article matrix doesn't look right."
assert user_item.sum(axis=1)[1] == 36, "Oops!  The number of articles seen by user 1 doesn't look right."
print("You have passed our quick tests!  Please proceed!")
You have passed our quick tests!  Please proceed!
2. Complete the function below which should take a user_id and provide an ordered list of the most similar users to that user (from most similar to least similar). The returned result should not contain the provided user_id, as we know that each user is similar to him/herself. Because the results for each user here are binary, it (perhaps) makes sense to compute similarity as the dot product of two users.

Use the tests to test your function.

np.dot(user_item.loc[1,:], user_item.loc[1,:])
Out[26]:
36.0

def find_similar_users(user_id, user_item=user_item):

    OUTPUT:
    similar_users - (list) an ordered list where the closest users (largest dot product users)
                    are listed first

    # sort by similarity
    sorted_similarity = sorted(similarity.items(), key=lambda kv: kv[1], reverse=True)

    # create list of just the ids
    most_similar_users = [key for (key, value) in sorted_similarity]
   
    # remove the own user's id
    most_similar_users.remove(user_id)
       
    return most_similar_users # return a list of the users in order from most to least similar
In [28]:
# Do a spot check of your function
print("The 10 most similar users to user 1 are: {}".format(find_similar_users(1)[:10]))
print("The 5 most similar users to user 3933 are: {}".format(find_similar_users(3933)[:5]))
print("The 3 most similar users to user 46 are: {}".format(find_similar_users(46)[:3]))
The 10 most similar users to user 1 are: [3933, 23, 3782, 203, 4459, 131, 3870, 46, 4201, 49]
The 5 most similar users to user 3933 are: [1, 23, 3782, 203, 4459]
The 3 most similar users to user 46 are: [4201, 23, 3782]

4. Now we are going to improve the consistency of the user_user_recs function from above.

Instead of arbitrarily choosing when we obtain users who are all the same closeness to a given user - choose the users that have the most total article interactions before choosing those with fewer article interactions.
Instead of arbitrarily choosing articles from the user where the number of recommended articles starts below m and ends exceeding m, choose articles with the articles with the most total interactions before choosing those with fewer total interactions. This ranking should be what would be obtained from the top_articles function you wrote earlier.

6. If we were given a new user, which of the above functions would you be able to use to make recommendations? Explain. Can you think of a better way we might make recommendations? Use the cell below to explain a better method for new users.

get_top_article_ids would be a better way for us to make recommendations because the user didn't view any articles before and we don't have any information about user

7. Using your existing functions, provide the top 10 recommended articles you would provide for the a new user below. You can test your function against our thoughts to make sure we are all on the same page with how we might make a recommendation.

That's right!  Nice job!
Part IV: Content Based Recommendations (EXTRA - NOT REQUIRED)
Another method we might use to make recommendations is to perform a ranking of the highest ranked articles associated with some term. You might consider content to be the doc_body, doc_description, or doc_full_name. There isn't one way to create a content based recommendation, especially considering that each of these columns hold content related information.

1. Use the function body below to create a content based recommender. Since there isn't one right answer for this recommendation tactic, no test functions are provided. Feel free to change the function inputs if you decide you want to try a method that requires more input values. The input values are currently set with one idea in mind that you may use to make content based recommendations. One additional idea is that you might want to choose the most popular recommendations that meet your 'content criteria', but again, there is a lot of flexibility in how you might make these recommendations.

This part is NOT REQUIRED to pass this project. However, you may choose to take this on as an extra way to show off your skills.

2. Now that you have put together your content-based recommendation system, use the cell below to write a summary explaining how your content based recommender works. Do you see any possible improvements that could be made to your function? Is there anything novel about your content based recommender?

This part is NOT REQUIRED to pass this project. However, you may choose to take this on as an extra way to show off your skills.
Write an explanation of your content based recommendation system here.

3. Use your content-recommendation system to make recommendations for the below scenarios based on the comments. Again no tests are provided here, because there isn't one right answer that could be used to find these content based recommendations.

This part is NOT REQUIRED to pass this project. However, you may choose to take this on as an extra way to show off your skills.

Part V: Matrix Factorization
In this part of the notebook, you will build use matrix factorization to make article recommendations to the users on the IBM Watson Studio platform.

1. You should have already created a user_item matrix above in question 1 of Part III above. This first question here will just require that you run the cells to get things set up for the rest of Part V of the notebook.

In [43]:
# Load the matrix here
user_item_matrix = pd.read_pickle('user_item_matrix.p')

2. In this situation, you can use Singular Value Decomposition from numpy on the user-item matrix. Use the cell to perform SVD, and explain why this is different than in the lesson.

In [45]:
# Perform SVD on the User-Item Matrix Here

u, s, vt = np.linalg.svd(user_item_matrix)# use the built in to get the three matrices
ANSWER: because in the lesson the user_item_matrix contains the rating, but in this project we only obtain whether the user has viewed that article.

3. Now for the tricky part, how do we choose the number of latent features to use? Running the below cell, you can see that as the number of latent features increases, we obtain a lower error rate on making predictions for the 1 and 0 values in the user-item matrix. Run the cell below to get an idea of how the accuracy improves as we increase the number of latent features.

In [46]:
num_latent_feats = np.arange(10,700+10,20)
sum_errs = []

for k in num_latent_feats:
    # restructure with k latent features
    s_new, u_new, vt_new = np.diag(s[:k]), u[:, :k], vt[:k, :]
    
    # take dot product
    user_item_est = np.around(np.dot(np.dot(u_new, s_new), vt_new))
    
    # compute error for each prediction to actual value
    diffs = np.subtract(user_item_matrix, user_item_est)
    
    # total errors and keep track of them
    err = np.sum(np.sum(np.abs(diffs)))
    sum_errs.append(err)
    
    
plt.plot(num_latent_feats, 1 - np.array(sum_errs)/df.shape[0]);
plt.xlabel('Number of Latent Features');
plt.ylabel('Accuracy');
plt.title('Accuracy vs. Number of Latent Features');

4. From the above, we can't really be sure how many features to use, because simply having a better way to predict the 1's and 0's of the matrix doesn't exactly give us an indication of if we are able to make good recommendations. Instead, we might split our dataset into a training and test set of data, as shown in the cell below.

Use the code from question 3 to understand the impact on accuracy of the training and test sets of data with different numbers of latent features. Using the split below:

How many users can we make predictions for in the test set?
How many users are we not able to make predictions for because of the cold start problem?
How many articles can we make predictions for in the test set?
How many articles are we not able to make predictions for because of the cold start problem?

t.sol_4_test(sol_4_dict)
Awesome job!  That's right!  All of the test movies are in the training data, but there are only 20 test users that were also in the training set.  All of the other users that are in the test set we have no data on.  Therefore, we cannot make predictions for these users using SVD.
5. Now use the user_item_train dataset from above to find U, S, and V transpose using SVD. Then find the subset of rows in the user_item_test dataset that you can predict using this matrix decomposition with different numbers of latent features to see how many features makes sense to keep based on the accuracy on the test data. This will require combining what was done in questions 2 - 4.

6. Use the cell below to comment on the results you found in the previous question. Given the circumstances of your results, discuss what you might do to determine if the recommendations you make with any of the above recommendation systems are an improvement to how users currently find articles?

Your response here. Increasing the latent features causes overfitting problem. Thus we can see from the above graph, the accuracy becomes worser when the number of latent features increases. Since the common users between the train and test set are too few, other recommendation methods may be used to improve our recommendation, like collaborative filtering or content based recommendation

We could use A/B testing to test how well our recommendation engine is working in practice to further engage users. We seperate two groups of user, one uses our recommendation engine and another uses random recommendation. we compare the hit rate of the recommendation articles to measure if our recommendation engine boost up the view count. If it is significant, we can conclude that our recommendation engine works well.


Extras
Using your workbook, you could now save your recommendations for each user, develop a class to make new predictions and update your results, and make a flask app to deploy your results. These tasks are beyond what is required for this project. However, from what you learned in the lessons, you certainly capable of taking these tasks on to improve upon your work here!
